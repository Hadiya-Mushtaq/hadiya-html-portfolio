# hadiya's-html-portfolio
A simple and clean personal portfolio website built using HTML. This project showcases my web development journey and includes links to my other mini-projects like the CSE PrepHub and Marriage Invitation Project. It's designed to be beginner-friendly and structured clearly using semantic HTML.
